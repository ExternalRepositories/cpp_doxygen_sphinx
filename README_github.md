# GitHub Actions for automagically deploying your website

This final part will be about getting GitHub actions to automagically deploy your website.

## Git

If you haven't already, initialize a `git` repo for your project:
```
git init .
```
A good `.gitignore` would be:
```
.vscode/
.DS_Store
build/
_build/
_static/
_templates/
```
